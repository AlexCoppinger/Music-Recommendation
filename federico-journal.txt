# GENERAL:
Virtual Environment Activation for each Session
venv = source venv/bin/activate




# CONCEPTS
    NAME:
    "DJ Smervin" (unofficial) aka "VibeLink" (official)


# WEEK 2
ACHIEVED:
- alex figured out how to setup the secret client_ID mechanism (to keep it hidden) 
- We finally have a running server that can run locally, with the html implemented correctly
    - will work on actual html page later (not current priority)
- We figured out spotify authentication, but not completely; next week need to figure out how to connect to spotify





# WEEK 3
CURRENT GOAL:
- Figure out how to gather data from spotify, and find out how and where to store it into a database for later usage
- We want to have enough playlist data for later training and testing for our machine learning model


Server finally running with html linked correclty to views.py
Need to work on gathering data with spotify API using spotipy:
    - need to work on playlist searching function inside spotify.py


Monday(04/14)

PlaylistSearch Notes:
    - you need forms in the forms.py file, in order to include the different fields that you might want (e.g. search for playlists, sort by, what to include)
    - each field has some default rendering once you render in views.py
    - 

Cleanup Function within PLaylistSearch class:
    -  checks for clean forms, to send back indicators of errors


Django Render:
    - takes request object coming in, and you can specify a template that you want to use (which is what you use to render the request; ex: search.html)
        - you can save templates in the app itself inside of a template folder, that has another folder inside of it that is also called by the app
        -  this can also a take a dictionary that includes variables that you want to use (it is a third possible parameter)
            - it gets sent to the django rendering engine and it will use it to place content correctly

    this is also why we have a form inside the html that has a POST method inside of it for users to interact with:

Inside of views.py there is also contenxt that can be added within the search playlist function, that is what is pushed inside of the render function
as the third parameter, to fill in the variables for the HTML




# INSIDE OF THE HTML

CSRF_TOKEN:
    - protects POSTS requests from something coming in from a fake site, so it blocks them from doing a POST request to your server (because you don't
    want a POST request to manipulate anything in your database)
    - it has {% CSRF_TOKEN %} ==> this notation shows that it is Django

FORMS:
    - uses doubel curly braces to refer to a variable in order to render it "{{"
    + a buttone is added



NOTE ABOUT SPOTIFY INFORMATION FETCHING:
    - need to create a loop in order to get spotify data and then use the given url to go on to the next batch of data, since it doesn't like
    returning everything at once


HTML NOTES:
- html hierarchy
- in the main content section (<main class = "container...) you'll haev a {% block content}{%endblock%}
==> this content section will be referenced in another html file where the information there will overwrite the other content block
- the base.html will be to create a sort of skeleton for things, and then index.html will extend base.html and have the actual content (so index
will be what has to be rendered)



DATABASE STUFF:

    - work inside the models.py file to create models for playlists or tracks finding using Django's models class (as models.Model)
    - inside the models.py make a class for Playlist(models.Model) and Track(models.Model)
    - these require a foreign key to link between track and playlist classes

    - Linking Table: where you store foreign keys that link both into the playlists and into each tracks
        - then have additional fields within this linking table in order to store this association (essentially they are just IDs)
    ==> this can be made as TrackXPlaylist(models.Model):
        - within this is where you can create an order variable that takes in the foreign keys?

==> all of this so far is just class models, but they have to be instantiated somewhere
(in the view don't forget to import the models)

MIGRATIONS:
    python manage.py makemigrations
    - that will create a migration file inside of the migrations folder of the app (this will automatically instantiate a migration)
- then you need to apply the migration:
    ython mangage.py migrate
        - this will then store this information within the default database (db.sqlite3) which is defined inside of settings.py
            - you can then access the databese from an app like DBeaver (just go on it and open the db.sqlite3 file)
            - once you do yo will find the different tables that we have to use
                - each one has its own primary key (ID) and other information (like the playlist one has e.g. description...)

    ==> how to now put stuff inside of the database?
    - go to views.py to the search function (e.g. search playlists) which already got playlists
    - (remember that you can also edit the fields that get put on the databse from the models, like the part that says "name = models.CharField...)


For database:
- might need to use AWS


SHELL (for running terminal)
- python manage.py SHELL




TRACKS + MODEL.py
- 




SHELL INTERACTION WITH Django

- python manage.py SHELL

(to do things inside of the terminal)


ACCESSING PLAYLISTS?:
from app.models import Class(ex: Track)
playlists = Playlist.objects.get(specific)
playlists = Playlist.objects.all() # all
playlists = Playlist.objects.filter() # filter operation

==> this will create a QUERY SET (list)
This will be a query set of all the playlists if you do all; you can then get a specific one out of them by indexing to it
--> then you can access parts of the playlist almost as methods with the period .
ex: p = playlists[4]
    p.name ==> this will give you the title

You can then manually use some of the attributes to get stuff:

p.track_playlists.all()[4] # 4th playlist





WEEK 4


pdb.set_trace()
- can be placed where you want code to stop and just return intformation that you can just access within the terminal


IDEAS:
- need user to have spotify account
- control player via API
- stop and rate the song ==> affects how the playback is going



WEEK 5 and 6

have it filter by whether a track already exists and then present the remaining ones in the generated playlist


"Even gods have bad days"
-- Alexis



SIMILARITY CONCEPT:
- correlation between playlists
    - finding how many playlists a track has in common with another (loop over)

- if bad rating:
    - search through playlists that that track is NOT part of and generate a random next track



playlist
- track 1
...


WEEK 7
Matrices?

Caching:
- by session, use in-memory cache
    - django has something like this (behaves like a dictionary) (local disk)

DJANGO CACHING:
- indicate in memory + 


Week 8

# MODEL - tables to store track coefficients that are based on user ratings + recommendation algorithm

class TrackCoefficient(models.Model):
    # store track coefficeints based on rating
    track = models.ForeignKey('Track', on_delete = models.CASCADE)
    algorithm = models.ForeignKey('Algorithm', on_delete = models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey('user', on_delete = models.CASCADE)
    coefficient = models.FloatField(default=0.0)
    created_at...
    updated_at...

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('track', 'algorithm', 'user')
        ordering = ['-coefficient']




# MODEL - for algorithm, to reference in the table store above

class Algorithm(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 255, unique = True)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    algorithm_type = models.CharField(max_length = 255, blank=True)

    callback = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=true)



==> implement "genre" spotify concept for the playlist search


make algorithm as a version of Janata's 
populate_candidate_playlist

- first use his thing to get the most popular FIRST track
- 



THE RATING PART:
- go in the views to rate_track(request)
    - in here add some WEIGHT UPDATING

# update the track weights in the TrackCoefficient model
# Fetch track coefficient instance or create a new one
tc = TrackCoefficient.objects.update_or_create(
    user=request.user,
    track=trackrating.track,
    algorithm='',
)

# In the track rating class put the method for coefficient UPDATING

def update_coefficient(self, algorithm_name):
    callback = Algorithm.objects.get(name=algorithm_name).



WEEK 7:
- finally completed the database architecture, track/playlist retrieval is all in place
and it's all finally viewable on DBeaver
- after each playlist/track search, the tracks/playlists are collected and stored into the database


WEEK 8:

- when it comes to scaling parameters, you want to have a different one depending on the algorithm that we
are working with, so instead of hard-coding the scaling into the algorithm function itself, 
go in the class and make a *DICTIONARY* of scaling factors based on the algorithm_type

NOTE: 
scaling_factor = lambda x: 1 / (1+(1/(1+x)))
(lambda is function on the fly)


- on specific runs where the rating is sub 3, still try to get the most popular track by coefficient and then
when you hit competitive tracks, get a random


+

For tracks that haven't been given a coefficient yet:
try:
    coefficient = tc_qs.get... (get fails when it doesnt exist)

except:
    coefficient = 0.0
