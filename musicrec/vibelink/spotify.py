#We want our Django app to:
# Authenticate itself with Spotify using the Client Credentials Flow
# Use the Spotify API to request public data
# Return that data via Django views or use it inside your app

# We use this spotipy to wrap the Spotify API in Python functions
# Use this module to organize the API logic
# Django views to interact with users and return data
