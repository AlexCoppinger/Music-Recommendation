# Week 1

This week I came up with the idea of the app
I created a plan and rough outline for how we will achieve it
I completed the README.md file and added it to our repository

# Week 2
I setup a proper coding environment
Submitted an application for gitHub education for copilot

Goals: 

Setup the virtual environment for Django 
Make the keys hidden
Begin writing code for the algorithms


Notes: 

Janata's pwap (program) file includes:

- migrations (a folder)
- templates/pwap (a folder with html code)
- __init__.py
- admin.py 
- apps.py 
- models.py 
- spotify.py 
- tests.py 
- urls.py ## this file is similar to ours from spotify_app
- views. py 

I am missing the spotify.py which probably comes from not linking my environment with the Spotify API
I am also missing urls.py which I don't completely understand the point of that one


Janata's psc182_s25--which I assume is analogous to our 'spotify_app' foldler-- includes:

- settings (which includes 3 files: __init__.py, dev.py, and settings.py)
-__init__.py 
- asgi.py  
- urls.py ## this file is also similar to ours but slightly different
- wsgi.py 


To do:

I don't know what the _pycache_ file in ours is for
_init__.py may need to be duplicated into another directory within our 'spotify_app'
There is no dev.py file anywhere, I forgot what it's for but there's barely anything in it in Janata's repository
There is a settings.py file in Janata's but within the settings directory--I'm assuming this may have something to do with the secret keys stuff
We need to make a requirements.txt file that includes packages we are using & whatever else


Moving forward, we need to add the spotify API, of which Federico has a specific one. 
We also need to come up with a proper name that makes it easier to organize this stuff--'music-recommendation' and 'spotify_app' and 'music_rec' aren't going to suffice
I am also very confused on what the venv is for. I'm worried I may have created the venv and not used it properly since I don't understand how it works
We need to understand how the keys mechanism works, and figure out how to implement the thing Janata did






Questions for Janata:

- How does the venv work? What's its purpose? When I was just told 
to put it, but I don't really know what it does--it also doesn't match
his files on his repository
- I forgot what his migrations file is for... why have it?
- It seems like I have two apps, although I'm not sure--is this actually needed?
ChatGPT 'told me' to do this, but I'm a bit confused on what is even going on and 
don't know what it's used for or whether it's even necessary
- Since I'm working with Federico, is there a specific convention he recommends to
deal with our code? I understand gitHub is good at doing this, but it may get annoying
to have to pull, commit, and push every single time. Is this needed? Is there a better way?
