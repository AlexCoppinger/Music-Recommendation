# Week 1

The name of this algorithm is VibeLink

This week I came up with the idea of the app
I created a plan and rough outline for how we will achieve it
I completed the README.md file and added it to our repository

# Week 2
I setup a proper coding environment
Submitted an application for gitHub education for copilot

Goals: 

Setup the virtual environment for Django 
Make the keys hidden
Begin writing code for the algorithms


Notes: 

before each coding session, write: source venv/bin/activate

Janata's pwap (program) file includes:

- migrations (a folder)
- templates/pwap (a folder with html code)
- __init__.py
- admin.py 
- apps.py 
- models.py 
- spotify.py 
- tests.py 
- urls.py ## this file is similar to ours from spotify_app
- views. py 

I am missing the spotify.py which probably comes from not linking my environment with the Spotify API
I am also missing urls.py which I don't completely understand the point of that one


Janata's psc182_s25--which I assume is analogous to our 'spotify_app' foldler-- includes:

- settings (which includes 3 files: __init__.py, dev.py, and settings.py)
-__init__.py 
- asgi.py  
- urls.py ## this file is also similar to ours but slightly different
- wsgi.py 


To do:

There is no dev.py file anywhere, I forgot what it's for but there's barely anything in it in Janata's repository
There is a settings.py file in Janata's but within the settings directory--I'm assuming this may have something to do with the secret keys stuff
We need to make a requirements.txt file that includes packages we are using & whatever else


Moving forward, we need to add the spotify API, of which Federico has a specific one. 
We also need to come up with a proper name that makes it easier to organize this stuff--'music-recommendation' and 'spotify_app' and 'music_rec' aren't going to suffice
I am also very confused on what the venv is for. I'm worried I may have created the venv and not used it properly since I don't understand how it works
We need to understand how the keys mechanism works, and figure out how to implement the thing Janata did

We need to figure out how to setup the spotify API thing, and get the keys






Questions for Janata:

- Since I'm working with Federico, is there a specific convention he recommends to
deal with our code? I understand gitHub is good at doing this, but it may get annoying
to have to pull, commit, and push every single time. Is this needed? Is there a better way?
- What method for securiing the 'secret key' is being used? 
- Why config.get for the spotify stuff but not config like for the secret key?
- Could we see the ini file to understand the format?
- What is the point of import pdb? what does the module pdb do?
- Just curious, but what does the module os do?
- I don't really understand the point of a dev.py file. It doesn't work regardless although I'm assuming it's allowing the DEBUG to be True?
